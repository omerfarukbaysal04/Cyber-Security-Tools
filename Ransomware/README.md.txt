Repository Purpose: Educational / Ethical Hacking Practice ONLY

--------------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER - LEGAL NOTICE
--------------------------------------
This project is for **educational purposes only**. It is designed to demonstrate how basic ransomware works by encrypting and decrypting local files using symmetric encryption with the Fernet module from the cryptography library.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT deploy or use this code on machines you do not own or have explicit permission to test on. Unauthorized usage may violate laws and regulations.

--------------------------------------
üì¶ Files Included
--------------------------------------

1. ransom.py
   - Encrypts all files in the directory except:
     - ransom.py
     - ransomdecrypter.py
     - generatedkey.key
   - Generates a symmetric encryption key (Fernet) and saves it as 'generatedkey.key'.

2. ransomdecrypter.py
   - Decrypts all files that were encrypted by 'ransom.py' using the key stored in 'generatedkey.key'.

3. generatedkey.key
   - Automatically generated by 'ransom.py'. Stores the Fernet key required to decrypt the files.

--------------------------------------
üõ† Requirements
--------------------------------------

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library (install via pip):

```bash
pip install cryptography


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use (Safe Environment)
Place a few test files (e.g., .txt, .md, etc.) in the same directory.

Run the encryption script:

python3 ransom.py
Check the contents of the files ‚Äî they will now be encrypted.

To decrypt them, run:

python3 ransomdecrypter.py
The original file contents should be restored.
